> Autonomous agents that automate data collection, experiment orchestration, and decision-making using the OpenAI SDK. Includes detailed interaction traces and logs for analysis.

Key highlights:
- Multi-step agent workflows for preprocessing, model suggestion, and result interpretation
- Tool and API integrations for data ingestion, experiment execution, and persistent logging
- Prompting strategies and evaluation metrics to measure agent behavior and reliability
- Reproducible experiments with detailed traces for debugging and analysis

Tech stack: Python · OpenAI SDK · FastAPI · async I/O · logging · experiment tracking

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/artik-gupta/Thesis_Stock_Price.git)

> Predicts stock price direction using sentiment features extracted from news headlines; compares sequence and tree-based models.

Key highlights:
- Headline scraping, cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization
- Sentiment feature engineering (VADER and transformer-based scores, rolling aggregates)
- Model comparison: LSTM (sequence) vs XGBoost (tree-based) with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Evaluation: directional accuracy, precision/recall, confusion matrices, and backtesting
- Reproducible notebooks with visualizations of predictions vs actuals

Tech stack: Python · pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · XGBoost · TensorFlow/Keras · NLTK/spaCy/VADER · BeautifulSoup/requests · matplotlib/plotly
