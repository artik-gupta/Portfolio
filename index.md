### Logistic Regression: Lead Classification

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/artik-gupta/Lead-Score-Case-study-assignment.git)
> This is a project done in the Data Science Post graduation course of IIIT Banglore.

In this project, a Logistic Regression model was trained and tested to classify whether a lead is a potential customer or not. 
Steps include:
1. A data set was taken and preprocessing has been done to clean and further improve the data. Various redundant columns have been removed and null values have been filled as per business understanding.
2. EDA including univariate and bivariate analysis.
3. Feature engineering.
4. RFE technique is used to eliminate the redundant feature having little importance.
5. Statsmodel library is used to train the model.
6. Finally I got around 83% accuracy in the test set and 78% on the train set.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, an Exploratory data analysis has been done including univariate and bivariate analysis.


### Linear Regression: Customer prediction

> This is a project done in the Data Science Post graduation course of IIIT Banglore.

In this project, a Linear Regression model was trained and tested to predict the number of customers by considering weather, season, holidays, and festivals.
Steps include:
1. The Statsmodel library is used to train the model. Various sets of features were being tried to reach an optimal feature set.
2. Residual distribution followed a normal distribution and R2 value of 78% was achieved.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
